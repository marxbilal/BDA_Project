integrating python with node.js

- create express server(server.js)
- define python class/functions

** Calling python script via child process:
- calling the spawn function to run the program(python nlp), and passing arguments including the class name and any parameters.
- using stdout to get the python file output, and then render it to the webpage.
- This process is quick and shorthand, but since the nested program runs, therefore performance can be compromised.

** Using a message broker
- runs python and node.js as separate processes
- uses message broker to communicate bw the two process
- RabbitMQ, amqplib for node; pika for Python
- two queues: to send requests and receive results
- RabbitMQ can be replaced by ZeroMQ for low latency
